# FACE-DETECT
This project helps in detecting human face in an Image file
In this project on Face Detection, I have created an algorithm using the programming language C++, which enables the user to provide the path of the image and detect the presence of human face in the image file.
Basically this project uses the Image Processing Library OpenCV hence it is categorized as an image processing project.
Image processing is used in AI or ML for training like some kind of pattern recognition system uses the image processing libraries so this project can be considered under the Machine Learning as well.
In the project to detect the face Haar based algorithm is used which helps in identifying the objects in the image such as the face of human in the image.
Results on the real time indicate that the proposed algorithm can accurately extract facial features points. The algorithm is applied on the real time camera input and under real time environmental conditions. 
Nowadays face detection and recognition in many industries such as mobile phone, security, policing etc. This project lays the basics of face detection and recognition which are surely going to be a major center for development in future.
